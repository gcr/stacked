You can hold up to three powerups that change the type of bullets you shoot. Perhaps they could also change the player's appearance? E.g. fire dude has flaming hair, zap dude's got electricity swirling around him, etc. ?

 Nothing              - boring ol' "Pew Pew Pew" pistol
 Water                - Just a water cannon, bullets affected by gravity.
 Fire                 - Light flamethrower
 Fire Water           - Napalm. Perhaps makes the ground all hot and sticks to the
                        floor for a while.

 Ice                  - Ice gun. Freezes opponents for fraction of a second.
                        Low rate of fire, of course.
 Ice Water            - Better water gun; makes the floor slippery.
 Ice Fire             - rocket-propelled ice?
 Ice Fire Water       - thermite that freezes the player while doing damage p'raps?

 Zapper               - Stronger "Pew Pew" pistol
 Zapper Water         - Bullets explode on contact, does splash damage (like
                        water splashes that hurt)
 Zapper Fire          - Light railgun
 Zapper Fire Water    - Fireworks - single charged projectile, does lots of
                        splash damage
 Zapper Ice           - High yield explosive (low damage)- throws your opponents far
                        away
 Zapper Ice Water     - Giant fridge falls out of the sky and crushes opponents.
 Zapper Ice Fire      - Projectile explodes against the wall, fragments shock whatever
                        they touch. (Thanks, Amanda!)
 Earth                - Throws rocks, affected by gravity, rocks bounce once.
 Earth Water          - Mud gun. Slows down opponents. Good for teamwork.
 Earth Fire           - A plant or something on fire. Bullet rolls on the ground
                        for a bit and burns anything it touches.
 Earth Fire Water     - Poison? Saps enemies' health for a spell?
 Earth Ice            - Makes icicles that sprout from the ground and form spikes
 Earth Ice Water      - Starts out as a water gun, but the projectiles slow down
                        and turn into deadly spikes that hang in the air
 Earth Ice Fire       - ???
 Earth Zapper         - Summon swarm of lightning bugs
 Earth Zapper Water   - ???
 Earth Zapper Fire    - FIRE DRILL! No seriously. A drill made out of fire. Meelee.
 Earth Zapper Ice     - Blizard gun. Snow fills the screen, blows opponnents arround.
